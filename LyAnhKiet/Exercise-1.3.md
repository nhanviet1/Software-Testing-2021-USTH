Exercise 1.3

What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?
- The risk mentioned here can be interpreted as the possibility of failure.
- The risk cannot be reduced to zero in most cases, as it is usually very hard to test all cases.
