Exercise 1.5

Below are four faulty programs. Each includes test inputs that result in failure. Answer the following questions about each program.

(a) Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code.

(b) If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not.

(c) If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not.

(d) If possible give a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. If not, briefly explain why not. Hint: Don’t forget about the program counter.

(e) For the given test case, describe the first error state. Be sure to describe the complete state.

(f) Implement your repair and verify that the given test now produces the expected output. Submit a screen printout or other evidence that your new program works.

# Program 1

## findLast()
```Java
// findLast()

public static int findLast (int[] x, int y)
   {
      // As the example in the book points out, this loop should end at 0.
      for (int i=x.length-1; i > 0; i--)
      {
         if (x[i] == y)
         {
            return i;
         }
      }
      return -1;
   }
```

a, Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code.

The given code intended to return the last index of a value y in an array x. However, the code does not look for the value y in the 0 index of x.  
A modification to the code:
```java
public static int findLast (int[] x, int y)
{ 
  // As the example in the book points out, this loop should end at 0.
   for (int i=x.length-1; i >= 0; i--) // change made here
   {
      if (x[i] == y) 
      {
         return i;
      }
   }
   return -1;
}
```
b, If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not.
Test case:
x = [1,2,3]  
y = 2

c, If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not.
x = [1,1,1]
y = 1

# Program 2

## lastZero
```Java
// lastZero()

public static int lastZero (int[] x)
   {
      for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         if (x[i] == 0)
         {
            return i;
         }
      }
      return -1;
   }
```

a, Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code.
This program intended to return the last index of 0 in an array x. However, it returns the index of the first 0 found.  
A modification to the code:  
```java
public static int lastZero (int[] x)
   {
      for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         if (x[i] == 0)
         {
            pos0 = i;
         }
      }
      if(pos0 != null){
      	return pos0;
      }
      return -1;
   }
```
b, If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not.
x = [0, 1, 2]


c, If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not.
x = [0]

# Program 3

## countPositive
```Java
// countPositive()

public static int countPositive (int[] x)
   {
      int count = 0;

      for (int i=0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         if (x[i] >= 0)
         {
            count++;
         }
      }
      return count;
   }
```

a, Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code.
This program intended to count positive elements of an array x. However, it also counts 0.  
A modification to the code:  
```java
public static int countPositive (int[] x)
   {
      int count = 0;
   
      for (int i=0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         if (x[i] > 0)
         {
            count++;
         }
      }
      return count;
   }
```

b, If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not.
x = [-2, 4, -6]

c, If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not.
Not possible

# Program 4

## oddOrPos
```Java
// oddOrPos()

public static int oddOrPos (int[] x)
   {  // Effects:  if x is null throw NullPointerException
      // else return the number of elements in x that
      //      are either odd or positive (or both)
      int count = 0;

      for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++)
      {
         if (x[i]%2 == 1 || x[i] > 0)
         {
            count++;
         }
      }
      return count;
   }
```

a, Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code.
This program intended to count positive and odd elements of an array x. However, it also counts 0.  
A modification to the code:  
```java
if (x[i] > 0)
{
  count++;
}
else
{
  if (x[i]%2 ==1 ) count++;
}
b, If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not.
x = [1, 2, 3]

c, If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not.
x = [1, 2, 3]
