# Exercise 1.4 #

## a) Write a Java method with the signature
```Java
import java.util.Vector;

class Vector_test {
    public static Vector union (Vector a, Vector b) {
        Vector v = new Vector();
        v.addAll(a);
        v.addAll(b);
        return v;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vector a = new Vector();
        a.add(10);
        Vector b = new Vector();
        b.add(8);
        Vector v = union(a, b);
    }
}
```

## b) Upon reflection, you may discover a variety of defects and ambiguities in the given assignment. In other words, ample
opportunities for faults exist. Describe as many possible faults as you can.

One of possible fault is lack of verification statements such as checking the two vectors are empty or have different dimensions.

## c) Create a set of test cases that you think would have a reasonable chance of revealing the faults you identified above. Document a rationale for each test in your test set. If possible, characterize all of your rationales in some concise summary. Run your tests against your implementation.
```Java
Vector a = new Vector()
Vector b = new Vector()
```
```Java
Vector a = new Vector();
a.add(10)
Vector b = new Vector();
```
```Java
Vector a = new Vector();
Vector b = new Vector();
b.add(8)
```

## d) Rewrite the method signature to be precise enough to clarify the defects and ambiguities identified earlier. You might wish to illustrate your specification with examples drawn from your test cases.
```Java
public static Vector union(Vector a, Vector b, boolean inv = False)
{
  if (a.isEmpty() && b.isEmpty()) return Null;
  else
  {
    if (inv)
    {
      Vector v = new Vector();
      v.addAll(b);
      v.addAll(a);
      return v;
    }
    else
    {
      Vector v = new Vector();
      v.addAll(a);
      v.addAll(b);
      return v;
    }
  }
}
```
